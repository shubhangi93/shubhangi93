## 💫 About Me

🔭 **I’m currently working on**  
Building **scalable frontend applications** using React, TypeScript, and modern UI systems, along with **AI-powered features** and performance optimizations.

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**  
Frontend-heavy projects, **React / React Native apps**, design systems, and AI-integrated products.

🤝 **I’m looking for help with**  
Advanced **frontend system design discussions**, performance tuning at scale, and cracking **top-tier product company interviews**.

🌱 **I’m currently learning**  
Frontend system design in depth, **CI/CD & DevOps for frontend**, AI integration in web apps, and advanced JavaScript patterns.

💬 **Ask me about**  
React, JavaScript, frontend architecture, performance optimization, interview prep, and real-world product development.

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I’ve built and scaled production apps for years — and I still love breaking things just to understand them better 😄
